The official Space Raiders 2016 git repo for the stronghold project.

The way we attempted to maintain this project was simple in theory: each
feature would be worked on in a seperate branch. Then, once everyone was
finished, all the branches would be merged into dev, where bugs would be
ironed out. Once tested, everything would be commited to master.

Unfortunately, this turned into a hot mess, and now Alex and Andrew have to
fix everything.

Time to start the [Wollack method](http://71.121.167.52:9001/alex/2016-stronghold/wikis/wollack-method)!
